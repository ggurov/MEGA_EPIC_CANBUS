I want to augment the transmission of variable_set frames to be more intelligent.
It should check if the value has changed since the last transmission and send it quicker, but if it hasn't it should wait longer between transmission of the same value
It should still read the input pins (analog, digital, and vss) and send them over canbus on their own schedules
Implement a simple state machine to handle this.
