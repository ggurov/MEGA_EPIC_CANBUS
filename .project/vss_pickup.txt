I wand to add reading of VSS to the project.
use arduino mega2560's interrupt inputs to count edges convert that to a generic pulses per second that can be sent over canbus to the ecu.

the variables for wheel speeds are:
{
    "name": "canVSSFrontLeft",
    "hash": -1645222329,
    "source": "output"
  },
  {
    "name": "canVSSFrontRight",
    "hash": 1549498074,
    "source": "output"
  },
  {
    "name": "canVSSRearLeft",
    "hash": 768443592,
    "source": "output"
  },
  {
    "name": "canVSSRearRight",
    "hash": -403905157,
    "source": "output"
  },


hashes from the above are used in variable_set frames

so we need to create a variable_set frame for each of the above variables with the hash and the value of the pulses per second.

using interrupt handlers to count edges (probably falling edges, as we'll want users to hook up an external VR conditioner)

count the edges, convert to pulses per second and send that over canbus for the 4 wheels.

provide mapping of digital pins to be used on the mega to what wheel sensor is connected to what pin.
